## Why is it called otavia?

Otavia antiqua is an early sponge-like fossil found in Namibia in the Etosha National Park. It is claimed to be the
oldest animal fossil, being found in rock aged between 760 and 550 million years ago. The genus was named after the
Otavi Group in Namibia in which the fossils were found. The oldest fossils are from the Tonian period, before the
Cryogenian glaciations, but the latest found were from the Nama Group rocks, which are from the Ediacaran period.

The shape of the fossils is irregular but rounded. The size varies from a third of a millimetre to 5 mm (0.20 in). They
are hollow inside, and have many small, osculum-like holes connecting the interior to the outside. The material of the
outer wall is predominantly calcium phosphate.
